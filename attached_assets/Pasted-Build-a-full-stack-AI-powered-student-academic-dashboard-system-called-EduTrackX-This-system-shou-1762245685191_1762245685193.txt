Build a full-stack AI-powered student academic dashboard system called “EduTrackX”.
This system should help students track academic performance, predict results, plan study schedules, and receive AI recommendations.

🎯 Core Requirements

Build a modern web app that allows:

✅ Student authentication (login/signup)
✅ Add subjects & marks (manual + OCR marks upload)
✅ Track assignments, deadlines, exam dates
✅ Attendance tracking
✅ Study time logging (Pomodoro timer)
✅ Dashboard with analytics:

GPA/CGPA calculation

Subject-wise performance charts

Attendance graph

Productivity stats

Deadlines & progress bars

✅ Notifications for deadlines (email or in-app)
✅ Export report card PDF

🤖 AI Features

Integrate the following AI modules:

AI Feature	Description
📈 Grade / CGPA Prediction	ML model based on past marks
🔍 Weak Subject Detection	Identify low-scoring areas
📚 Study Recommendations	Suggest chapters, resources, schedule
🧠 AI Study Mentor Bot	Explains concepts, answers academic questions
📊 AI Performance Insights	“You improved in Math, review DBMS”
📝 OCR Marks Reader	Upload screenshot/PDF → auto-extract marks
📅 AI Timetable Planner	Daily/weekly recommended study schedule

ML Model Specs

Train on synthetic sample dataset if real data not provided

Algorithms: Random Forest / XGBoost / Linear Regression

Export model via joblib and load in backend

🎨 UI & UX

Modern clean UI with:

Sidebar navigation

Dashboard cards

Line & Bar charts (Chart.js / Recharts)

Dark mode

Mobile responsive

Progress bars, badges, streak counters

Pages to include:

Page	Purpose
Home Dashboard	KPIs + Charts
Subjects & Marks	CRUD + graphs
Assignments	Deadlines + calendar
Attendance	Mark & view charts
Study Planner	Pomodoro + schedule
AI Assistant	Chat interface
Profile	Student settings
🏗️ Tech Stack

Use this stack:

Layer	Tech
Frontend	React / Next.js + Tailwind
Backend	Python Flask / FastAPI
Database	MongoDB Atlas or Firebase
Charts	Chart.js / Recharts
OCR	Tesseract.js / Python Tesseract
AI	HuggingFace / Local model (No paid API)
Auth	JWT or Firebase Auth

Also support:

PWA mode for mobile

Cloud deployment script

Environment variable template
